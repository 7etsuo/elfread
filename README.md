# elfread
> This code is a command-line utility that allows users to display information about ELF (Executable and Linking Format) files. It provides options for displaying the ELF file header, program headers, and section headers, and includes functions for reading and writing files to and from memory. The program takes a number of flags as input, such as -h, -l, -S, and -e, which determine which information to display. The code also includes arrays of strings that provide human-readable descriptions of various constants and identifiers used in ELF files.
